Quartz is a full-featured, open source job scheduling service that can be integrated with, or used along side virtually any Java application - from the smallest stand-alone application to the largest e-commerce system. Quartz can be used to create simple or complex schedules for executing tens, hundreds, or even tens-of-thousands of jobs; jobs whose tasks are defined as standard Java components that are programmed to fulfill the requirements of your application.
